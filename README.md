# Project structure

I used container/components structure for my project so that I could specify all logical functionality in container and only rendering in components.

## Packages highlights

1. styled-components - This package makes style nested objects more simple and readable 
2. react-query - super package for REST API built-in lots of utils like Apollo's GraphQL useQuery
3. Typescript for less buggy development


## Install

1. Clone project
2. ```yarn install```
3. ```npx pod-install```
4. ```npx react-native run-ios/run-android```
